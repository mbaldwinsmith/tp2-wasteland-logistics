# WASTELAND LOGISTICS — CONCEPT DOCUMENT

## 1. Vision
**Wasteland Logistics** is a full-overhaul mod for *Transport Fever 2*, transforming the game into a post-war reconstruction experience. Set a century after global collapse, players build trade routes, reconnect isolated settlements, and revive industry in a world where scarcity, salvage, and ingenuity define survival.

This mod aims to create a world that *feels* inspired by rust-punk and post-apocalyptic aesthetics while using completely original assets and lore.

## 2. Core Themes

### Reconstruction, not domination
The world has already burned. No factions fight; instead, people rebuild.

### Scavenger ingenuity
Vehicles, buildings, and industries reflect creative repurposing of old-world parts.

### Environmental storytelling
Ruined highways, flooded coasts, skeletal towers, and improvised settlements set the tone.

### Hope through connection
Every route built materially improves the world, visibly growing settlements and restoring civilisation.

## 3. Setting: The Reclamation Era
A century after *the Great Silence*, humanity survives in scattered pockets surrounded by ruins and wasteland. Transport is the lifeblood of all recovery efforts. As a **Reclaimer**, you are tasked with stitching these communities together and enabling the rebirth of industry.

### Biomes
- **Shattered Coast:** flooded city ruins, rusted docks, fog  
- **Ash Plains:** bone-dry dustlands, scrapyard fields  
- **Verdant Fringe:** mutated forests, overgrown farmlands  
- **High Barrens:** cold plateaus, solar research hubs  
- **Deadlines:** unstable hazard zones increasing maintenance costs

## 4. Gameplay Pillars

### Pillar 1 — Salvage-Based Economy
Industries are redesigned around scavenging, purification, and reconstruction.

**Early game**

### Pillar 2 — Progressive Vehicle Eras
Players advance through four technological eras:

1. **Scavenger Years** — improvised engines, jury-rigged buses, patched steamers  
2. **Reconstruction Dawn** — repaired diesels, early electrics  
3. **Revival Age** — green-energy trains, aerostats, VTOL rebuilds  
4. **New World Era** — lev-rail hybrids, nuclear-powered monorails

### Pillar 3 — Rebuild the World
Map generation and asset packs reshape the landscape:
- collapsed highways  
- derelict buildings
