**Wasteland Logistics** transforms Transport Fever 2 into a rust-punk, post-collapse rebuilding sim.  
Set a century after global devastation, scattered settlements depend on you — a **Reclaimer** — to reconnect the world through trade, industry, and ingenuity.

This mod introduces new biomes, industries, vehicles, assets, UI, and a fully redesigned economy built on scrap recovery, renewable energy, and rediscovered pre-war technology.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> *Rebuild the world in motion.*  
>  
> Wasteland Logistics is hopeful post-apocalyptic fiction — a story not about collapse, but about what comes after: the slow, determined work of rebuilding civilisation one trade route at a time.
